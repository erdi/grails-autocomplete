This is a bash script (originally written by Fernando Takai) that allows auto-completion of grails commands from the command line. Basically extending the bash-like auto-completion functionality to include grails commands.

To use it you have to have gawk (it's default on some linux distros -- but on mac, you have to install trough mac ports)

To start using it you need to add this:
[ -r /path/to/the/file ] && source /path/to/the/file

To the top of your ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile scripts.

For your changes to take affect you must open a new shell or re-login to your current shell (su - your_user).

To use it, just go your grails project and try:
grails list<tab>
grails create<tab><tab>
grails create-a<tab><tab>
